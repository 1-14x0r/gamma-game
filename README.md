##
Incoming Transmission...

I heard you were part of H.A.X.O.R.; here is your first assignment: 

We have begun the experimental phase of project Gamma. The initial results are more inspirational, despite the frustration of the industry that surrounds our group. Project phase A has been based from Fallout, Fortnite, Diablo, Quake, Dungeon Keeper, Minecraft, Skyrim, Rifts and Gamma World of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D). Of course I could easily encrypt these transmission for you with closed source, but what is the fun in that; sharing is caring after all. 

Its been 11 days since we first recieved our first signal from deep space, and have been directed  to develop this as a crowd source project. You might already know the advantages this has, despite the disadvantage of you making a ton of money. After all our hope is to provide a world that we once remembered. This should allow as many survivors as possible to be able to have access to this technology. Yes; other groups are using Unity3d and Unreal to provide unprecedented project performance. Have you heard about WebGL with three.js?

There is only a short amount of energy left to encode this message.. I must hurry.. 

Your assignment in Gamma has and always will be to create a free to play. After all, why charge for the survival of the human race. This mission is hardcore, and will most likely take your life. Congratulations for discovering this transmission I have started.

hhhcck... the battle drones are after me....
